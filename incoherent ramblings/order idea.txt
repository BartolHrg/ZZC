hdr
	pragma once
	#	includes
	#	forward declare classes (struct S;)
	type declarations (typedefs classes usings )
	declarations
src
	include hdr
	#	includes
	#	forward declare classes (struct S;)
	type declarations
	declarations
	implementations

everything should be sorounded by same macroes (except defines)
	every file will have 2 parts:
		declaration
		definitions

i have to be careful because default arguments must appear only once
that is only in declaration
both for templates and for functions
